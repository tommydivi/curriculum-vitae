    <h2>Playing the Guitar</h2>
    <p>I am a self-taught guitarist from the age of 14. My love for guitar all started on a quiet, rainy Sunday. No
    money in my pocket, my friends were all busy, so I decided to pick up the dusty acoustic guitar that had been sat
    in my brothers room for the good part of a year acting as a glorified conversation piece.</p>
    <p>I stuck on a few YouTube tutorials teaching me the basics: tuning, fretting, simple major and minor chords, reading
    tablature and before I knew it, it kind of took over my life a little bit. I started playing with friends in a little after
    school band called Glasses Are For Young Horses (don't ask), then a few years later a more serious local band called
    The Quincies. Although I no longer play in a band, I do play casually as a way to switch off and disconnect my brain if I'm having a
    bad day. </p>
    <p><strong>I currently own 3 guitars:</strong></p>
